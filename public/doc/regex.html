    <h1>Regex for ;ldb</h1>
    <p>The ;ldb leaderboard command supports regex whilst using the -r tag.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p><code>;ldb -r /^noob/i</code></p>
    <p>Basic regex is formatted with two forwards slashes, with the search query going between the slashes and the settings at the end.</p>

    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <h3>Anchors</h3>
    <code>
^Start.    - matches any string that starts with "Start."
End$       - matches any string that ends with "End."
    </code>
    <h3>Quantifiers</h3>
    <code>
123*       - matches any string that has a 12 followed by zero or more of the character 3.
123+       - matches any string that has 12 followed by one or more of the character 3.
123?       - matches any string that has 0 or 1 of the character 3.
123{2}     - matches any string that has 12 followed by 2 3s.
123{2,}    - matches any string that has 12 followed by 2 or more 3s.
123{2,5}   - matches any string that has 12 followed by 2 to 5 3s.
1(23)*     - matches any string that has 1 followed by any amount of the sequence "23".
1(23){2,5} - matches any string that has 1 followed by 2 to 5 of the sequence "23".
    </code>
    <h3>OR Operators</h3>
    <code>
1(2|3)     - matches any string that has a 1 followed by a 2 or 3, and captures 2 or 3.
1[23]      - same as above, but does not capture 2 or 3.
    </code>
    <h3>Character matches</h3>
    <code>
\d         - matches any single character digit.
\w         - matches any word character (alphanumeric + underscore).
\s         - matches any whitespace character (space, tab, 0 width, etc).
.          - matches anything.
    </code>
    <p>You can capitalise the characters in the backspace to make them match the opposite, e.g. \D would match any non-digit, and \S would match any non-whitespace character.</p>
    <p>In order to be taken literally, you must use the escape characters ^.[$()|*+?{\ with a backslash as they have a special meaning.</p>
    <code>
\$\d       - matches a string that has a $ before one digit.
    </code>
    <p>You can also match non-printables like newlines, tabs, and returns (although impossible to name a ship with the latter) with their respective backslash identifiers (\n, \t, and \r.)</p>
    <h3>Flags</h3>
    <p>regex is normally comes with the form /abc/, where the search pattern is identified by being inbetween the two slashes (/). At the end we can specify specific flags that will affect how the search comes out.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>g</b> (global) does not return after the first match, restarting the subsequent searches from the end of the previous match.</li>
      <li><b>m</b> (multi-line) [useless for ;ldb search] when enabled ^ and $ will match the start and end of a line, rather than the whole string.</li>
      <li><b>i</b> (insensitive) makes the entire string case-insensitive.
    </ul>
    <h3>Brackets</h3>
    <code>
[abc]      - matches any string that has either an a or a b or a c. same as (a|b|c).
[a-c]      - same as previous.
[a-fA-F0-9]- matches any single hexadecimal character.
[0-9]h     - matches any number before a h.
[^a-zA-Z]  - matches any character that is not a lower or upper case alphabetic character.
    </code>
