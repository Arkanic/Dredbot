well done for finding the source code.

Q: I want to use some of this code:
A. All of this code is free to use, so long as you provide credit to me (Arkanic) in some way that is VISIBLE TO THE END USER/CLIENT. I'm not so much concerned about small things, but if you are copying a majority of the code/multiple core components, i'd rather you dm me on discord (Arkanic#3976) for a bit of background information.
